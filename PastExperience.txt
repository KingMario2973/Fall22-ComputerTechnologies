1. My experience with computer hardware is very limited. Aside from the occational breadboard or lego robot building, I have almost no experience in computer hardware.

2. I believe I have always used a windows computer.

3. I have used many production software for a variety of purposes including but not limited to: school presentations, and data storage for both school and personal projects.

4. I have quite a bit of programming expirience with html, css, javascript, python, c++, and c#. Most of my physical expirience came from school programming classes but I occationaly like to program side projects utilising block based lanquages such as Scratch or Snap!

5. I reguly use Youtube as a streaming service to watch videos and Reddit as social media. I also use Discord to keep in touch with my former classmates aswell as friends I have made online through various means.
