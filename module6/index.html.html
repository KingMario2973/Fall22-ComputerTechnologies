<h1>Cheese</h1>
<h2>Section 1: What is Cheese?</h2>
<p>According to <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese"><i>Wikipedia</i></a>, "Cheese is a dairy product produced in wide ranges of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep." Edible cheese can be found in many forms such as being streatched into snack sized sticks or melted into a liquid in combination with various other edibles. Cheese also has an extreamly long shelf life since it is a dry food making it a very good source of dairy.</p>
